# Widening and Narrowing

Widening, also known as upcasting is a conversion that takes place in the following situations -
Widening is taking place when a small primitive type value is automatically accommodated in a bigger/wider primitive data type.

Narrowing also known as downcasting/casting is a conversion that takes place in such situations -
Narrowing a wider/bigger primitive type value to a smaller primitive type value.
